IMPORTANT: You need to create an og-image.jpg file (1200x630px) for social media sharing.

You can:
1. Use Canva.com to create a branded image with your site name
2. Use any graphic design tool
3. Take a screenshot of your best quote and resize to 1200x630px

Place the image at: public/og-image.jpg

For now, the metadata references this file but it needs to be created manually.
