Mahajan's Quotes ("we", "us", "our") operates https://quotes-website-self.vercel.app/ (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how it may be shared, and the choices you have. By using the Site, you agree to the practices described here.

## 1) Information We Collect

- Administrator account data: email/username and a securely hashed password used only for site administration and sign‑in (via NextAuth.js). This is not shared or sold.
- Usage data: IP address, device/browser information, pages visited, referring/exit pages, timestamps, and approximate location derived from IP. This is primarily collected via cookies and similar technologies for analytics, security, and advertising measurement/personalization.
- Information you provide: If you contact us, we collect the information you submit (e.g., name, email, message).

We do not otherwise collect personal information from regular visitors beyond what is described above.

## 2) Cookies and Similar Technologies

We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to:

- Remember preferences (e.g., liked quotes or UI settings)
- Measure performance and improve the Site
- Deliver, measure, and personalize advertising

You can control cookies in your browser settings. Disabling cookies may impact Site functionality. Learn more about cookies at https://www.allaboutcookies.org/

## 3) Advertising and Google AdSense

We display ads served by Google AdSense and/or other third‑party vendors. These vendors use cookies and similar technologies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this and/or other websites. Google’s advertising cookies enable Google and its partners to serve personalized ads to you.

## 5) Consent and Google Consent Mode (EEA/UK)

If you are visiting from the EEA/UK, we honor your consent choices for advertising and analytics cookies. We use Google Consent Mode v2 so Google adjusts ad measurement and personalization based on your consent status.

Where the GDPR/UK GDPR applies, we process personal data under the following legal bases:

- Consent (e.g., analytics/advertising cookies where required by law)
- Legitimate interests (e.g., Site security, non‑personalized measurement)
- Performance of a contract and/or compliance with legal obligations

## 7) Your Rights and Choices

- EEA/UK users may have rights to request access, rectification, erasure, portability, restriction/objection to processing, and to withdraw consent at any time.
- California (CCPA/CPRA) residents may have rights to know, delete, correct, and opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information (as defined by California law). We do not sell personal information for money; limited “sharing” may occur for advertising measurement.

To exercise rights, contact us using the details in the “Contact Us” section. We may need to verify your identity before acting on your request.

## 8) Data Retention

We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, unless a longer period is required or permitted by law (e.g., tax, accounting, or compliance obligations).

## 9) Children’s Privacy

The Site is not directed to children under 13 (or a higher age where required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under that age. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to remove it.

## 10) Data Sharing and Transfers

We may share information with service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics, advertising, security) under appropriate confidentiality and data protection obligations. We may also disclose information where required by law or to protect our rights.

Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for international transfers.

## 11) Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 12) Do Not Track

Your browser may offer a “Do Not Track” (DNT) setting. Our Site does not currently respond to DNT signals. You can manage cookies and advertising preferences via the opt‑out links above.

## 13) Changes to This Policy
